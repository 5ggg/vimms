For IAPI assembly binding to work, copy the file `python.exe.config` and the folder `PSI_Interface` to the same location as the Python interpreter in the virtual environment, e.g. `C:\Users\joewa\.virtualenvs\vimms-eWhZMuNZ\Scripts`

If there's still a problem loading assemblies, use https://github.com/awaescher/Fusion to troubleshoot.
