Virtual Metabolomics Mass Spectrometry (ViMMS)
==============================================

ViMMS is a modular LC-MS/MS simulator framework for metabolomics that allows for real-time scan-level control of the MS2 acquisition process in-silico. ViMMS allows users to simulate and test different fragmentation strategies and obtain fragmentation files in .mzML format as output from the simulation (the entire state of the simulator can also be saved for inspection later).

Installation
------------

1. Install Python 3.6.6.
2. Install pipenv (https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
3. In this directory, run `$ pipenv install` to create a new virtual environment and install all the packages we need.
4. Run jupyter notebook. Examples are available in the `notebooks` folder.
